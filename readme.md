# Dating app 
This is a project for my backend assesment and Project Tech. It it is a dynamic website using Git, Express, Node.js and MongoDB / Mongoose. This dating app is for users who support one of the 18 Eredivisie football clubs in the season 2019/2020.

In this app you can sign-up, login, view other users who signed-up, view your own profile and delete your profile. The app is only for mobile devices ðŸ“±.
