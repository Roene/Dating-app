# Dating app 
This is a project for my backend assesment and Project Tech. It it is a dynamic website using Git, Express, Node.js and MongoDB / Mongoose. This dating app is for users who support one of the 18 Eredivisie football clubs in the season 2019/2020.

In this app you can sign-up, login, view other users who signed-up, view your own profile, edit your own profile and delete your profile. The app is only for mobile devices ðŸ“±.

## Install
To install this project you have to clone it first. 
*Use your terminal and go to your folder where you want this project.*
Then you have to do this:
```
git clone https://github.com/Roene/Dating-app.git
cd Dating-app
```
Now you have the project local. Next step is to get all the npm packages you can do this with this command:
```
npm install 
```
Now you have to create your own database. You can follow installation instructions [here](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas). If you have created your database you have to create a file named `.env` in here you put the following things:
```
MONGODB_URI=<url to database>
DB_NAME=<database name>
JWT_KEY=<random string>
```
Now you can run the project using the following command:
```
npm start
```
**or**
```
npm test
```
You can visit the app in:
```
localhost:3400
``` 
and not in localðŸ‘»

## Database structure
To send data to the MongoDB database I made a Mongoose schema, here you can see how the schema works. You can find it in **model/user.js**. 
```js
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    firstname: {
        type: String,
        required: true
    }, 
    surname: {
        type: String,
        required: true
    }, 
    age: {
        type: Number,
        required: true
    }, 
    gender: {
        type: String,
        required: true
    }, 
    club: {
        type: String,
        required: true
    }, 
    image: {
        type: String,
        required: true
    }, 
    email: {
        type: String,
        required: true
    }, 
    password: {
        type: String,
        required: true
    }, 
    searchGender: {
        type: String,
        required: true
    }, 
    description: {
        type: String,
        required: false
    }, 
    tokens: [{
        token: {
            type: String,
            require: true
        }
    }]
})
```

## Code
I tried to split up the code, in the *views folder* you can find all the ejs pages and partials. In the *db folder* you can find the connection to the database. In the *middleware folder* you can find the auth.js file, this file is for the authentication when a user is loggedin or not. In the *routes folder* you can find user.js file this handles the routes when a user goes for example to `localhost:3400/login` or other routes that is connected with user functions like sign-up or user profile. In the root of the project you can find index.js, this is the server file where I tell where the server runs and what the template engine is. 

## Render data
To render data from the database I have chosen for the ejs template engine. This is an example in my project. You can find it in **views/pages/dashboard.ejs**. 
In this file I render data from the database in my ejs template. First I get the data from backend see **routes/user.js**
```js
    // Render the dashboard expect with the user who is signed in. 
    .get('/dashboard', auth, async (req, res) =>  {
        try {
            const users = await User.find({ _id: {$ne: req.user._id}, club: {$in: req.user.club} }).lean()
            res.render('pages/dashboard', { users })
        } catch (err) {
            res.status(500).send(err)
        }
    })
``` 
The data from the database is saved in users expect the logged in user and send with the response to the frontend where you can access it. The second argument in the query is to filter the club. All users have filled in a football club from the Eredivisie. We only want to see the users who filled in the same football club. The `.lean()` is for performance because we give a custum query to the model.  
```js
<body>
<%- include ('../partials/header') %>
    <section>
        <% users.forEach((user, index) => { %>
        <article style="background-image: url('/static/upload/<%= user.image %>'); background-repeat: no-repeat; background-size: cover;">
            <p><%= user.firstname + " " + user.surname + " " + user.age%></p>
            <p><%= user.club %></p>
            <p><%= user.description %></p>
        </article>
        <% }) %>
    </section>
<%- include ('../partials/nav') %>
</body>
```
Now you get the dashboard with all the data you asked. It wil render article with uploaded image as background and three paragraphs.

## Update data
When we want to update data we render the page *profile-edit*, this can be found in the folder **views/pages/profile-edit.ejs**. In here there is a form where the user can edit the personal information. In the backend we make a get request to render the page with the information from the logged in user. This can be found in the folder **routes/user.js**
```js
    .get('/profile-edit',  auth, (req, res) => { 
        try {
            const user = req.user
            res.render('pages/profile-edit', { user } ) 
        } catch (err) {
            res.status(500).send(err)
        }
    })
```
Then we have a form in our front-end where the user change the personal information. This post request can also be found in the folder **routes/user.js**. 
```js
    // Here I update the data from the user. In the const user I store the loggedin user object from the database. 
    // Then I have the form in the Front-end the user filled in, after that I save the new information and redirect to the profile.
    .post('/profile-edit', auth, async (req, res) => {
        try {
            const user = req.user

            user.firstname = req.body.firstname,
            user.surname = req.body.surname,
            user.age = req.body.age,
            user.gender = req.body.gender,
            user.club = req.body.club,
            user.email = req.body.email,
            user.searchGender = req.body.searchGender,
            user.description = req.body.description

            await user.save()
            res.redirect('/profile')
        } catch (err) {
            res.status(500).send(err)
        }
    })
```
First we store the logged in user in the const user. Then we checked the information the user filled in in the form. After that we will save the updated user information again to the the database and we redirect the user back to the profile page.
